### Parametric t-SNE
In [Laurens, 2009](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/publications/papers/AISTATS_2009.pdf), the authors propose training a stack of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) as a parametric form of t-SNE. In particular, they train a network with 3 hidden layers [500-500-2000] and an output layer of size 2, which represents the predicted 2D embedding.

The training procedure involves performing backprop on the t-SNE loss function. As a refresher, _P_ and _Q_ are the pairwise conditional distributions of data points in the high- and low-dimensional map respectively. With a fixed input, the t-SNE loss function is purely a function of the embedding matrix _Y_ as determined by the network weights.

#### Experiment 1
In the following, two architectures were used: a simple feedforward net (as above) and a graph net. The networks were trained on MNIST data, with a training set of 10,000 samples, using the t-SNE loss above. Both networks were run for 800 epochs. 

The trained networks are then used on a test set of 3,000 samples. Below, we compare three visualisations obtained from the following methods: t-SNE, simple net and graph net.

We can also make a quantitative comparison of the three visualisations:

It is possible that the graph net doesn't work very well because the computed neighbourhood graph is noisy/poorly constructed. Some possible directions include:
  * Testing the method of graph structured data like the [CORA citation network](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/CORA).
  * Finding a way to improve the neighbourhood graph.
  * Initializing network weights by supervised training with pre-computed t-SNE samples.
