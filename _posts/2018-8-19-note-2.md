### Spectral CNNs

| CNN Operation        |  In Spectral CNNs          |
| ------------- |-------------|
| Non-linearities     	| Transform data in the spatial domain |
| Convolution         	| Filter data in the frequency domain |
| Pooling         		  | Apply graph coarsening, retains a fraction of the graph vertices |
| Conv + stride         | Keep only the low-frequency components of the spectrum <br> Subsampling of frequency multipliers + interpolation kernel (cubic splines) |
