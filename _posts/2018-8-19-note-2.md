### Spectral CNNs
	
| CNN Operation        | Spectral Equivalent           | 
| ------------- |-------------|
| Non-linearities     	| Applied in the spatial domain |
| Convolution         	| Apply filters on data in the frequency domain |
| Pooling         		| Graph coarsening, retain a fraction of the graph vertices |
| Conv + stride         | Keep only the low-frequency components of the spectrum \
	Subsampling of frequency multipliers + interpolation kernel (cubic splines) |
