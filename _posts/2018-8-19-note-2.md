### What does the graph Laplacian represent?
_L = D - A_
![](https://github.com/signapoop/signapoop.github.io/blob/master/public/graph_laplacian.png)

* _L_ is symmetric and positive-semidefinite
* Every row sum and column sum of _L_ is zero.
* _L_ is singular.
* _trace(L) = 2m_ where _m_ is the number of edges of the graph.
* The Laplacian is a local operator since it only considers the immediate neighbors of each node.

### Eigenvalues / eigenvectors of L
* Non-negative and real-valued eigenvalues
* _N_ orthogonal eigenvectors
* _(1,1,…1)_ is an eigenvector of _L_ with eigenvalue = 0
* The multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 is given by the number of connected components in the graph.
* The Fielder value is the second smallest eigenvalue of _L_ and approximates the sparsest cut of a graph.

### What does the Fielder value represent?
* The magnitude reflects how well the overall graph is connected.
* The second smallest eigenvalue of _L_ is the solution to an optimisation problem.

### Spectral clustering
* Changes the representation of data points using the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian enhances the cluster properties in the data
* Does not make strong assumptions on the form of the clusters
* Use the normalized graph Laplacian
* Make sure the similarity graph is sparse -> using kNN or epsilon-neighbourhood
* Sensitive to choice of parameters for constructing the neighbourhood graph

### Summary of spectral CNN operations

| CNN Operation        |  In Spectral CNNs          |
| ------------- |-------------|
| Non-linearities     	| Transform data in the spatial domain |
| Convolution         	| Filter data in the frequency domain |
| Pooling         		  | Apply graph coarsening, retains a fraction of the graph vertices |
| Conv + stride         | Keep only the low-frequency components of the spectrum <br> Subsampling of frequency multipliers + interpolation kernel (cubic splines) |
