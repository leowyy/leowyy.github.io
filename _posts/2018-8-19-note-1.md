### Clustering goals
Partition a set of points into disjoint sets such that:
  * Points in the same group are _similar_
  * Points in different groups are _dissimilar_
  * Formally, we want a graph partition with minimal cut

### Clustering variants
  * Similarity-based: given a _N x N_ dissimilarity matrix or distance matrix _D_
  * Feature-based: given a _N x D_ feature matrix or design matrix _X_
  * Flat clustering: partition into disjoint sets
  * Hierarchical clustering: partitions are organised in a tree structure

### Associated problems
  * Multi-view clustering: cluster feature vectors, not data points
  * Label prediction: given a point, predict its label

### Clustering algorithms
  * k-means
  * Hierarchical clustering
  * Gaussian mixtures
  * Spectral clustering
  * Affinity propagation
  * Infinite mixture model (Dirichlet process)

### Clustering metrics
  * Graph cuts - cut score & conductance of the graph
  * Purity - requires ground truth class labels, does not penalise for # clusters
  * RAND score
  * Mutual information
