<h3>TREC Questions Classification</h3>
The Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) Questions Classification dataset is one of many downstream NLP tasks used to evaluate sentence embeddings. It consists of 5,452 training and 500 test questions organised into one of six categories:

<h4>Sentence embeddings</h4>
Google's Universal Sentence Encoder [Cer, 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.11175.pdf) was used to embed the questions into 512-dimensional vectors. The encoder seeks to embed sentences into a vector space whilst preserving semantic similarities, which can then be used for downstream NLP tasks.  

Using t-SNE, we can visualise the vectors in 2D. Furthermore, we can make a few observations:
* Questions with similar semantics are clustered together. For example, the cluster at the bottom left relates to questions about fear. The clustering occurs regardless of the ground truth labels. 
* Clustering by semantics naturally yields some extent of clustering by answer type.
