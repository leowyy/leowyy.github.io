  Hey there! 
</p> -->

Hi, I'm a fourth year computer science undergraduate at [Nanyang Technological University](http://scse.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx). After one year of studying at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/computing/), and interning with [McLaren Applied Technologies](https://www.mclaren.com/appliedtechnologies/), I'm excited to be back in Singapore. My final year project is titled "An Experimental Study of Graph Neural Networks", and I am delighted to be supervised by [Prof. Xavier Bresson](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/xbresson/). 

Thanks for reading!
